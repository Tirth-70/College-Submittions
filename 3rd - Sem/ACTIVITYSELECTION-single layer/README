## Program Details

This program uses a linked list data structure to store the activities. Each activity is represented as a node in the linked list. The nodes contain information about the activity, such as its name, start time, finish time, and serial number.

The program allows the user to insert activities into the linked list in sorted order based on the finish time. It also allows the user to delete activities by their serial number.

The program uses the activity selection algorithm to find the best activities to be selected. The algorithm works by selecting activities in order of their finish time, starting with the activity that finishes first. For each activity, the program checks if it overlaps with the previously selected activity. If it doesn't overlap, it is added to the list of selected activities.
